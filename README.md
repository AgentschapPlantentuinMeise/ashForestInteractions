Ash ([*Fraxinus excelsior* L.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_excelsior)) is an important species in European forests. However, in recent years it has been severely impacted by ash-dieback disease ([*Hymenoscyphus fraxineus* (T. Kowalski) Baral, Queloz & Hosoya 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoscyphus_fraxineus)). It is also threatened by emerald ash borer ([*Agrilus planipennis* Fairmaire, 1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer)). Currently, emerald ash borer has not reached the European Union, but is invasive in the United States and Russia.

The species interactions in this *repository* will supplement those already in [GloBI](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/) to build a clear picture of those species that maybe impacted by a decline in ash in Europe.
